#include <iostream>
// include= includes differnet types of files in our program like iostream
// iostream =(its a header file for taking input and output)
using namespace std;
// to avoid writing std:: before cout

int main()
// main function tells compiler this is where to start execution
{
    // cout works because iostream is included or imported
    cout << "Hello World\n";
    // std shows the output inside quotation marks like hello world
    // \n next line // semicolon means statement ends
    return 0;
    // return 0 means to go out of the program
} 
//curly brackets indicate where function starts and ends
